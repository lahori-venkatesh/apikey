# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Secure API Key Management & Usage Tracking Platform is a web application that enables developers to securely store, manage, and monitor their API keys across multiple services. The platform addresses the common pain points developers face when managing multiple API keys by providing secure storage, real-time usage tracking, subscription monitoring, and a professional dashboard interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create an account and securely log in, so that I can access my personal API key management dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide fields for name, email, and password
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create a new account with hashed password using BCrypt
3. WHEN a user attempts to log in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and provide a JWT token
4. WHEN a user provides an invalid email or password THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a user's JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 2: API Key Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely store my API keys with metadata, so that I can organize and manage keys from different services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a new API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt the key using AES encryption before storage
2. WHEN a user adds an API key THEN the system SHALL require service name, description, and optional expiry date
3. WHEN a user views their API keys THEN the system SHALL display service name, description, status, and creation date without showing the actual key
4. WHEN a user activates or deactivates an API key THEN the system SHALL update the key status accordingly
5. WHEN a user deletes an API key THEN the system SHALL permanently remove it from storage
6. WHEN a user updates API key metadata THEN the system SHALL save the changes while maintaining encryption

### Requirement 3: Usage Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track API usage for each key, so that I can monitor my consumption patterns and avoid exceeding limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API key is used THEN the system SHALL increment the usage count for that key
2. WHEN a user views usage analytics THEN the system SHALL display daily, weekly, and monthly usage statistics
3. WHEN usage exceeds 80% of quota THEN the system SHALL display an alert notification
4. WHEN a user selects a time period THEN the system SHALL show usage data for that specific period
5. WHEN usage data is displayed THEN the system SHALL present it in chart format using visual components

### Requirement 4: Subscription Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track my API subscription details and limits, so that I can manage my usage within plan constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a subscription THEN the system SHALL store service name, plan type, usage limit, and expiry date
2. WHEN a user views subscriptions THEN the system SHALL display current usage as a percentage of the limit
3. WHEN a subscription is near expiry THEN the system SHALL show the remaining time
4. WHEN usage approaches the limit THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar indicating consumption level
5. WHEN a user updates subscription details THEN the system SHALL save the changes and recalculate usage percentages

### Requirement 5: Dashboard User Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a professional and intuitive dashboard, so that I can efficiently navigate between different management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL display a responsive dashboard with sidebar navigation
2. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL provide tabs for API Keys, Usage Analytics, and Subscriptions
3. WHEN displaying charts and analytics THEN the system SHALL use professional visualization components
4. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain usability with responsive design
5. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and loading states

### Requirement 6: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my sensitive API keys and data to be protected, so that I can trust the platform with my credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using AES encryption
2. WHEN user passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using BCrypt
3. WHEN users communicate with the system THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS communication
4. WHEN JWT tokens are issued THEN the system SHALL include appropriate expiration times
5. WHEN a user accesses protected resources THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens before granting access

### Requirement 7: Data Persistence and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my data to be reliably stored and organized, so that I can access my information consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use MongoDB collections for Users, ApiKeys, Usage, and Subscriptions
2. WHEN API keys are associated with users THEN the system SHALL maintain proper user-key relationships
3. WHEN usage data is recorded THEN the system SHALL link it to the appropriate API key and user
4. WHEN subscription data is stored THEN the system SHALL associate it with the correct user account
5. WHEN data queries are performed THEN the system SHALL return only data belonging to the authenticated user
